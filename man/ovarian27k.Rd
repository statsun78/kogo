\title{Ovarian cancer 27K DNA methylation data}
\description{DNA methylation data were generated from Illumina Infinium
HumanMethylation27K Beadchip between ovarian cancer cases and healthy controls
For each individual, methylation beta values of 20,461 CpG sites are available. }
\usage{ovarian27k}
\format{
  The format is a list containing four components: \code{genename},
  \code{group}, \code{x}, and \code{y}. \code{x} contains the 20,461 methylation
  values for 275 subjects and \code{y} records the 152 controls and 123 cancer
  cases. \code{group} indicates the number of CpG sites for alphabetically
  ordered genes and \code{genename} contains Illumina ID and gene symbol for each
  CpG site.
